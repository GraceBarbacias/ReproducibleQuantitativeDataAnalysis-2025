Here we make a small exercise on provenance!
Given the data in the .csv file on Melanie's ice cream habits, have a look at the IPython notebook and the analysis presented there. You cna visualize the notebook on GitHub. Now try and redo the “scientific” analysis presented to you there! You can do it in your favorite programming language/analysis program.

**For teachers:** use the ProvenancePractice notebook with students - their job being to figure out how to obtain the same results
